# === Subtitle Acquisition Script Setup ===

# API_KEY: Your OpenSubtitles consumer API key
# USERNAME: Your OpenSubtitles username
# PASSWORD: Your OpenSubtitles password
# API_URL: OpenSubtitles API endpoint (only rename when OpenSubtitles changed their API URL)

# - LANGUAGES: Comma-separated list of subtitle languages to download (e.g. nl,en). These are the languages for which subtitles will be searched and downloaded. Very important setting.
# - AUDIO_TRACK_LANGUAGES: Comma-separated list of audio track languages to keep inside video files (e.g. nl,en,ja). ('undefined' tracks are always kept). Tracks with a language not in the list are removed. Highly recommended to keep english in there, as 95% of all mainstream movies have english tracks only
languages= nl,en
audio_track_languages= nl,en,ja

# ACCEPT_OFFSET_THRESHOLD: If a subtitle synchronisation is below this threshold, then the subtitle will be accepted without needing further manual user verification. Generally speaking: A higher setting saves time, but may result in poorer syncs being accepted unconditionally. A lower setting leads to only very excellently synced subtittles getting through. Try finding your ideal balance by testing it on videos. I personally find that somewhere between 0.05 and 0.1 strikes a good balance
accept_offset_threshold= 0.05

# REJECT_OFFSET_THRESHOLD: If a subtitle synchronisation is above this threshold, then the subtitle will be rejected, meaning it will be marked as DRIFT and will be discarded later.Generally speaking: Higher settings will lead to less rejections, but more manual checkups for you to go through. Lower settings will lead to very fast rejections, making videos run out of subtitle candidates very quickly. NOTE: Increasing the threshold is usually recommended when you notice that many movies can't find good subtitle candidates anymore. I personally find that 1.2 seconds strikes a good balance.
reject_offset_threshold= 1.2

# - SERIES_MODE: If true, treat all videos in the same folder as episodes of a TV series. If false, only the largest video file in each folder is processed (movie mode).
# - DELETE_EXTRA_VIDEOS: If true, all extra video files in a folder will be permanently deleted. If false, extra video files will be moved to a folder named by EXTRAS_FOLDER_NAME. This setting is ignored if series_mode is true (in series mode, all videos are kept).
# - EXTRAS_FOLDER_NAME: Name of the folder where extra video files are moved if DELETE_EXTRA_VIDEOS is false.
series_mode= false
delete_extra_videos= false
extras_folder_name= extras

# PAUSE_SECONDS: Number of seconds to pause between phases, breaks, and other script waits. If you don't mind about reading what happens in the terminal, a lower value can be set. Example: 5 means a 5 second pause between phases and after summaries. Average speed = 5.
pause_seconds= 5

# MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS: Maximum number of subtitle search results to consider per movie (e.g. 10). Increasing MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS can help find more options, but may slow down processing. When having a low download limit, it's strongly recommended to not go higher than 6
max_search_results= 20

# TOP_DOWNLOADS: Number of subtitles to download and test per batch. Keeping TOP_DOWNLOADS low preserves your daily download limit by first testing one batch before downloading another batch. If you have a low download limit, then 1, (max 2) is strongly recommended
top_downloads= 3

# - SKIP_DIRS: Comma-separated list of directory names to skip when scanning for videos (e.g. extras,trailers,samples). These directories will be ignored during video discovery in both movie and series mode. Use lowercase names, matching is case-insensitive. Common examples: extras, trailers, samples, bonus.
skip_dirs= new folder,nieuwe map,extra,extra's,extras,featurettes,bonus,bonusmaterial,bonus_material,behindthescenes,behind_the_scenes,deletedscenes,deleted_scenes,interviews,makingof,making_of,scenes,trailer,trailers,sample,samples,other,misc,specials,special_features,documentary,docs,docu,promo,promos,bloopers,outtakes

# UNWANTED_TERMS: Comma-separated list of words/terms that should be filtered from subtitle search results. For example, a search can be 'Lord of the Rings 2001 [h.265 HEVC 10 bit]'. The whole latter part would then be removed, so that 'The lord of the Rings 2001' remains, giving a good search query.
UNWANTED_TERMS= sample,cam,ts,workprint,unrated,uncut,720p,1080p,2160p,480p,4k,uhd,imax,eng,ita,jap,hindi,web,webrip,web-dl,bluray,brrip,bdrip,dvdrip,hdrip,hdtv,remux,x264,x265,h.264,h.265,hevc,avc,hdr,hdr10,hdr10+,dv,dolby.vision,sdr,10bit,8bit,ddp,dd+,dts,aac,ac3,eac3,truehd,atmos,flac,5.1,7.1,2.0,yts,yts.mx,yify,rarbg,fgt,galaxyrg,cm8,evo,sparks,drones,amiable,kingdom,tigole,chd,ddr,hdchina,cinefile,ettv,eztv,aXXo,maven,fitgirl,skidrow,reloaded,codex,cpy,conspir4cy,hoodlum,hive-cm8,extras,final.cut,open.matte,hybrid,version,v2,proper,limited,dubbed,subbed,multi,dual.audio,complete.series,complete.season,Licdom,ac,sub,nl,en,ita,eng,subs,rip,h265,xvid,mp3,mp4,avi,Anime Time,[Anime Time]
